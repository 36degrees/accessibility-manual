  Screen readers read out P45 as 45p
</h2>
<p>
  When referring to the tax document known as a P45, a screenreader will sometimes 
  read out 45p. 
</p>
<p>
  We found that the language settings of the device caused the issue. If the device 
  is set to USA English then it read out 'P45'. But if the device was set to 
  British English, the screenreader assumed 'P45' to be currency and instead 
  read out 45p.
</p>
<p>
  We found that we could fix the issue for JAWs by adding a visually hidden non-
  breaking space. However NVDA would still read out 45p. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  <code class="html">
    P&lt;span class="govuk-visually-hidden">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>45
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  We recommend adding the visually hidden non-breaking space and adding the following 
  paragraph to your accessibility statement:
</p>
<p class="govuk-inset-text">
  We know some screen readers will read out the tax form known as a Pay as you earn 45 
  as 45p. This happens if your language is set to British English and your screenreader 
  assumes it is money.
