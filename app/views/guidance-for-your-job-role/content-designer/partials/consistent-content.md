### Consistent content

The content should be consistent across the service. For example, if the button at the bottom of each page is labelled "Continue", then it should be labelled "Continue" on other pages, and not something similar like "Next".

Consistent doesn't always mean identical. For example if you have a link which says 'Go to page 4', then it would be acceptable to have 'Go to page 5' on the next page.

Links on the same page which go to the same place should be consistent in their wording.
