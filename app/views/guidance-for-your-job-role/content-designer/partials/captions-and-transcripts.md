### Captions and transcripts

If you're providing audible content then you need to provide a transcript so that people with hearing impairments can still understand the information.

The same applies if you provide a video. Closed captions should be available for any dialogue to help people with hearing impairments, and audio description should be available for people with visual impairments.

A transcript can be provided as an alternative format to audio and video. It should be available in HTML and linked to on the same page as the video. It should include any dialogue and a description of what each scene in the video is portraying.
