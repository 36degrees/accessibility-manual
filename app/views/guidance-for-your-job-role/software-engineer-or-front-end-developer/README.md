As an Software Engineer or Frontend Developer, you have one of the most important roles when it comes to accessibility. A design can have considered accessibility, but it's up to you to build it to work correctly.

By using existing libraries and frameworks such as GOV.UK Frontend and DWP CASA, you can get a lot of accessibility for free.
