### 1 thing per page

If you need to ask questions in your service, always start with 1 thing per page rather than using multiple fields and conditional reveals.

Use the [GOV.UK design pattern for question pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/).

Keeping the content of pages simple is one of the easiest ways to make them accessible. 1 thing per page is less disorientating for users and reduces the cognitive load.
