  Links make sense out of context
</h3>
<p>
  For any link, remove everything else on the page and make sure it still 
  makes sense. For example "Change" is not clear when you view it in 
  isolation, but "Change bank details" is. 
</p>
<p>
  If you need to, you can use visually hidden text to add context to a link. 
  This is text which is still read out by a screen reader but cannot be seen 
  on the screen. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;a href="#">Change &lt;span class="govuk-visually-hidden">bank details&lt;/span>&lt;/a>
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Never use a link which tells the user to "Click here". The word "click" 
  makes an assumption that a mouse is being used, but the user could be 
  using a keyboard or some form of assistive technology.
</p>
<p>
  You should work with a content designer to make sure your links make sense 
  both in and out of context.
