## Correct formatting
Just like with headings, you should always use the correct formatting for the different elements in your context. For example, a quote should be programmed as a quote and not just styled to look different.

In PDFs you should tag all your elements to be identified correctly. In Word you should use the styles pane to programme your text accordingly.
