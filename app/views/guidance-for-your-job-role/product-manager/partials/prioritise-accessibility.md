### Prioritise accessibility

Any team will develop it's own culture overtime. It's beliefs and priorities will be moulded by the way things get done from week to week. 

If you de-prioritise accessibility then it becomes acceptable to the team to keep doing so, because it's easier. As the Product Manager you need to ensure this does not happen.

By prioritising accessibility from the very start, it just becomes part of the culture of the team, and part of the process. This will allow you to deliver at pace and meet your legislative requirements, rather than accessibility becoming a bottleneck or a blocker.
