### Programme headings
A heading which looks like a heading, and a heading which has been programmed to behave like a heading are very different.

Don't just use a bigger or bolder font. They may look visually like headings, but if they aren't actually defined as headings then assistive technology won't recognise them correctly.

In PDFs you should tag your headings properly. In Word you should use the correct heading styles.
