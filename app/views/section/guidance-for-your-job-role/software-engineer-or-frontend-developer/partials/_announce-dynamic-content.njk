  Announce dynamic content
</h3>
<p>
  If the content of a page changes dynamically, such as a pop-up or using 
  live data, you must announce the changes to a screenreader.
</p>
<p>
  Usually this would be done using the aria-live attributes. Adding aria-live to 
  an element will tell the screenreader that it needs to monitor that content 
  because it is likely to change at some point.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you have a live chat function, the screenreader would need to 
  know every time a new message was available. By adding aria-live to the chat 
  window, every time you append something to it the screenreader will read it out. 
  By setting it to polite, it means the screenreader will finish anything it is 
  already reading before reading out the appended message.
  <pre>
    <code class="html">
      &lt;div id="chat-window" aria-live="polite">
        &lt;p>
          Hello, how can I assist you?
        &lt;/p>
      &lt;/div>
    </code>
  </pre>
