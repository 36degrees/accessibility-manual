## Colour contrast fails on HM Government logo

The colour contrast in the most recent version of the footer in the Design System is 4.1:1. Most automated tools will work to a ratio of 4.5:1 so will may this up as a false positive.

Under [WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-contrast), this logo is not an issue because it meets a ratio of 3.1:1 and also does not contain information which is required to understand context.

It is recommended that you make sure the footer component is the most up to date version and record this error as a non-issue.
