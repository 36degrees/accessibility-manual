### Valid code

Assistive technologies rely on code being valid. Like a browser, if the code is not valid, then the technology has to try and guess how it should be interpreted, and this can make them behave in an unpredictable way.

When building anything for the web, all HTML, CSS and JavaScript needs to be valid. You can run your HTML and CSS through a validator such as [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), and the console in the browser should also be free from JavaScript errors.
