### Use HTML wherever possible

Statistical documents have historically been in downloadable formats such as PDF. But, PDFs can be unpredictable depending on how they've been tagged for accessibility.

Wherever possible, statistical documents should be produced using HTML. This will make them much more accessible for users who rely on assistive technology.

If HTML is absolutely not possible, make sure the additional work is done to make sure the alternative documents are tagged correctly or available in a range of different formats.
