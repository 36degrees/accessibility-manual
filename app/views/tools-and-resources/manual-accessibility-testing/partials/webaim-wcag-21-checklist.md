## WebAim WCAG 2.1 checklist

The [WebAim WCAG 2.1 checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist) is their recommendations for implementing accessibility principles and techniques. It is not a replacement for [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), but it might help you understand some of the criteria in a simpler format.

The list covers all the criteria from A to AAA, and the ones which are highlighted represent the criteria which are new to 2.1 and weren't in older versions of WCAG.
