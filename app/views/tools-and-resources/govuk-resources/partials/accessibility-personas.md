## Accessibility Personas

You can use the in-depth [GOV.UK Accessibility Personas](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles) to help you think about accessibility early on in your product design. Before you have recruited real users and built prototypes, using accessibility personas can help you to keep accessibility at the forefront of your service.

It should be noted that personas will never replace talking to real users, but they can be a useful tool in the early stages of your discovery work.

You can read a [GDS blog post about accessibility personas](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/11/using-persona-profiles-to-test-accessibility/).
