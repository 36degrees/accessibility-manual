### Make sure the team consider accessibility

As the direct link between the team and the users, it is important that the user researcher makes sure their needs aren't de-prioritised.

Even before you have identified users in your own service, you can make your team aware of the [GOV.UK user profiles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles) and how different impairments might affect people using the service.
