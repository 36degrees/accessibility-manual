### Alternative text for non-text content

For images, consider if they're meaningful or decorative. Do they add context or are they purely decorative?

If an image is meaningful, you must provide alternative text. This means somebody who cannot see the image can still understand what the image is showing.

For example:
<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat wearing sunglasses." />
  </code>
</pre>
You should work with a Content Designer to make sure your alternative text is clear and simple.

If an image is purely decorative, you should work with a Frontend Developer to make sure it is hidden from screen readers.
