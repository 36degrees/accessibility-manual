  Valid code
</h3>
<p>
  Assistive technologies rely on code being valid. Like a browser, if the code 
  is not valid, then the technology has to try and guess how it should be interpreted, 
  and this can make them behave in an unpredictable way.
</p>
<p>
  When building anything for the web, all HTML, CSS and JavaScript needs to be valid. 
  You can run your HTML and CSS through a validator such as <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">
  W3C Markup Validation Service</a>, and the console in the browser should also be 
  free from JavaScript errors.
