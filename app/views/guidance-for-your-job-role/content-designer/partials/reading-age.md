### Reading age

It is recommended that we write for a reading age of 9\. This makes it easier for everybody to understand regardless of their education or background.

You can test the reading age of your content with a tool such as [Hemingway](http://hemingwayapp.com) or [WebFX](https://webfx.com/tools/read-able).

You can [read more about reading age in the GOV.UK guidance](http://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#reading-skills) or from the following GDS blog post: [Writing content for everyone](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/23/writing-content-for-everyone/).
