## Colour
Don't just change all of the colours for the sake of it. The use of colour should be well considered. Are you changing the colours just because you think it looks nicer? Or are you trying to draw attention to certain information?

If you do use colour, make sure it isn't the only method of communication. The ability to see colour must be treated as a luxury and not a requirement. 

Before exporting your document, remove all the colour and make sure it still makes sense.
