## Record a Goose Sighting: Training

[Record a Goose Sighting](https://record-a-goose-sighting.herokuapp.com/) is a fictional service which has been coded to include deliberate accessibility issues based, such as missing alt text and broken heading hierarchies.

There is the [Record a Goose Sighting worksheet](https://record-a-goose-sighting.herokuapp.com/steps/worksheet) for you to work through and the [Record a Goose Sighting answers](https://record-a-goose-sighting.herokuapp.com/steps/answers) so you can see if you found everything.

You can also view the [Record a Goose Sighting project on Github](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/record-a-goose-sighting) and read the blog post [training people to do accessibility reviews](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/) to understand more about the project.
