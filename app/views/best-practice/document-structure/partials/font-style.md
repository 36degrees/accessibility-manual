### Font style
You should always use a clear font. Fancy fonts can be difficult to ready for anyone and they are particularly difficult for people with visual impairments.

Sans-serif fonts are often easier to read than serif fonts. A sans-serif font means a font which does not have any small lines attached to the ends of the characters.

Using common sans-serif fonts such as Arial or Helvetica will make your documents feel familiar and easier to read.
