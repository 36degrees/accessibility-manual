### GOV.UK Frontend

If you're building a service for GOV.UK then you will need to use [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), and you will need to use version 3.0 or newer as older versions are not WCAG 2.1 compliant.

If you're building a service for internal use or some other purpose, you might still want to consider using GOV.UK Frontend because it gives you a lot of accessibility for free.

GOV.UK Frontend comes with templates and style sheets. It comes with accessible considerations built in such as colours, line-heights, letter spacing and responsive layouts. It will also allow you to use any of the components in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

You can use the templates in an unbranded mode. So even if you want to brand your website or service differently, you can still get all of the benefits of using GOV.UK Frontend.

If you choose not to use GOV.UK Frontend, then it's likely you will need to do additional work both in development and testing.
