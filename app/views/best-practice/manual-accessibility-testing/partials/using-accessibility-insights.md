### Using Accessibility Insights

[Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/) is a great tool for accessibility. Like a lot of other browser plugins; it can do automated testing, but what sets it apart is the assessment tool.

The assessment tool will guide you through checking the page against the WCAG criteria. It can overlay helpers onto the page itself. For example, to show you the tabbing order, which colours fail contrast ratios or what the level is of each heading.

There is guidance built in so, so before you do any tests it will explain what you need to do. Then, when you've completed the test you can record if it passed or failed. At the end of each assessment you can export the test data to a HTML report which will show you which WCAG criteria passed and failed.
