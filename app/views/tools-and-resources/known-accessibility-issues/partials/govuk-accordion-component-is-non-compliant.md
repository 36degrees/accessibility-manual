## GOV.UK Accordion component is non-compliant

The GOV.UK Design System was audited in September 2020 and the [Accordion component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/) was found to be non-compliant.

The reason for this is that the headings look like links but behave link buttons. This fails [WCAG 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships).

Until the component is fixed, it is not recommended to use the GOV.UK Accordion component.
