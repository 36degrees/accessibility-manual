Accessibility is a combination of good design and robust development.

You can read some of the best practice documentation and see how you can apply it to your own work. 

Best practices are a guideline. They should remain flexible. You don't need to follow them strictly in order to benefit from them. You can use them to structure your own processes and find out what works best for your own team.
