# Guidance for your job role

People aren't always sure how accessibility is relevant to their job role. People often think it's just down to the Designers and the Developers. But every role in a multidisciplinary team has a part to play. 

For all common roles in digital we have tried to outline what you need to consider with regards to accessibility.

If you can't find your role or you think we've missed anything, your [feedback](https://github.com/dwp/accessibility-manual/issues/new) will help us to improve it.
