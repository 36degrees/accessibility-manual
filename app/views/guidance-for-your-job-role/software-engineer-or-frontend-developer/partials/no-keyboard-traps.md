### No keyboard traps

A keyboard user must be able to enter and exit sections without ever needing to use a mouse.

For example, if the user enters a pop-up window, but cannot focus the close button to exit the pop-up, this would be a keyboard trap.

Another example is a social media feed which uses an infinity scroll mechanism to constantly load in more posts as you near the bottom of the section. This could potentially trap the keyboard user from ever reaching the content beyond it.

The easiest way to check this is just to use the tab and arrow keys to interact with every part of the page. If at any point you need to refresh the page to get out of something, then this would be a fail.
