## GOV.UK Date component does not work with Dragon

There is a known issue with number fields and Dragons inability to edit them. It also affects old versions of the GOV.UK Date component as it used number fields.

The issue was not with the Date component, but with Dragon. However as it affected the component so much, a workaround was implemented in more modern iterations of the Date component.

It is recommended that you update the component to use the most recent version from the GOV.UK Design System.
