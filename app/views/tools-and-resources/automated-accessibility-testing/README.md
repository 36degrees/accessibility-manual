# Automated accessibility testing

Automated accessibility testing is an easy way to find obvious errors. It should always be a check you do against anything you build, but it is not enough to guarantee accessibility.

GDS did an [audit of automated tools](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/) and found that out of 142 known accessibility issues, the best tools only found around 30 to 40 percent. So it is important to make sure you do manual testing also.
