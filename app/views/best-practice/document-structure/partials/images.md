## Images
A lot of people use images to make things look fancy rather than there actually being a need for it. If you're going to use an image, think about if it is really needed and if there is no other way to get that content across. 

If you do use an image, you must provide alternative text, and you must not use assumptions such as "as you can see from this image" or "shown in figure 1".
