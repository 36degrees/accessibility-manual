## Accessibility Insights

[Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) is a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) tool which is available as a browser plugin. It offers automated accessibility testing, but what sets it apart is the ability to guide you through a manual assessment. 

The [manual assessment](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/assessment/) feature of Accessibility Insights really sets it apart from other browser plugins, as we know from a [GDS audit of automated tools](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/), automated tools will not find everything and should not be relied upon. 

The guided manual assessment will give you a better understanding of how accessible your website is, and it even provides a HTML report which can be downloaded and kept as evidence.
