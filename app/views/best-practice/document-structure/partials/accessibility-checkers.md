## Accessibility checkers
You should always use an automated accessibility checker to check your documents to make sure you have not introduced any obvious errors.

They won't find all errors but they might help you find some of the common ones such as missing alternative text.

If you're creating a PDF, you can use something like Adobe Acrobat DC to check your document, and if you're using Word you can use the built in accessibility checker.
