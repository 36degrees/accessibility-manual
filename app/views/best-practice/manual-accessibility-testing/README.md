# {Accessibility testing} Manual testing

Manual accessibility testing is essential to make sure your website is accessible. 

You can't rely on [automated testing](/tools-and-resources/automated-accessibility-testing). A [GDS audit of automated tools](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/) found that out of 142 known accessibility issues, the best tools only found around 30 to 40 percent.
