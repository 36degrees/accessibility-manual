### Keyboard focus

Every interactive element on the page needs to be accessible to a keyboard. This means you should be able to press the tab and arrow keys to navigate links, form inputs and submit buttons without any issues.

The focus must be visible at all times when using a keyboard. This means it must never focus anything which is off the page or obscured by another element. It must also be styled in a way so that it has enough contrast between any text and the background.

If you're using GOV.UK Frontend, you will need to be using version 3.0 or newer to get the compliant focus styles. The old versions will fail WCAG on focus contrast. You can read more about the updated GOV.UK styles in the following GDS blog post: [We've made the GDS Design System more accessible](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-made-the-gov-uk-design-system-more-accessible/) .
