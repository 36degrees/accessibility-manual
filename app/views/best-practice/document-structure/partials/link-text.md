## Link text
For any link, remove everything else on the page and make sure it still makes sense.

An example of a bad link would be:
`Click here` to check if you're eligible for a free puppy.

An example of a good link would be:
You can `check if you're eligible for a free puppy`.

Never use a link which tells the user to "Click here". The word "click" makes an assumption that a mouse is being used, but the user could be using a keyboard or some form of assistive technology.
