  Summarise charts and graphs
</h3>
<p>
  Charts and graphs can be difficult for everybody, especially if they're unusual 
  or complex. They are a particular challenge for people with visual or 
  cognitive impairements.
</p>
<p>
  If you are displaying a chart or a graph, then you must provide a high level 
  summary so that if people can't read it they can still understand what it shows.
</p>
<p>
  You should put summaries in the body of the page. Often people assume that putting 
  the summary in the alt attribute of the chart is a good approach. Although this 
  would provide an overview for screenreader users, it isn't just people with 
  visual impairments who will benefit from the summary. So it should be on the page 
  and available to all users.
</p>
<p>
  Along with a summary, you should also link to the source or the data which 
  was used to generate the chart. This is good for transparency, but it also means 
  that for people who can't perceive or understand the chart they still have 
  access to the raw data.
