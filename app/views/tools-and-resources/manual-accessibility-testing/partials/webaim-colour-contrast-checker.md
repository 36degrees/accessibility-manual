## WebAim colour contrast checker

Large text needs a ratio of 3:1 and normal text needs a ratio of 4.5:1. 

The minimum size to be considered 'large text' is 14 point if bold and 18 point if not. 

Don't get confused between point and pixels, they are not the same. A point is physical unit of length, and a pixel is a single dot on a screen. 1 point does not equal 1 pixel. 14 point is _usually_ 19px and 18 point is usually 24px.

The [WebAim colour contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) is a tool to make sure your colour combinations meet the right contrast ratios.
