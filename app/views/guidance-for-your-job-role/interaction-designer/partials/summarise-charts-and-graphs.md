### Summarise charts and graphs

For charts or graphs, you should summarise what the chart is showing and provide the data you used to generate the chart. This means people who can't see it can still easily understand what it is showing, but can also access the raw data if they want to look at it themselves in more detail.

For example:
This chart generated from <a id="testlink" href="#" aria-label="Fake link to Office for National Statistics data">Office for National Statistics data</a> shows that from 1980 to 2020 the number of families in the UK who own a dog has risen from 1 in 20 to 1 in 4.

You should work with a data analyst to make sure the chart, the data and the summary all align.
