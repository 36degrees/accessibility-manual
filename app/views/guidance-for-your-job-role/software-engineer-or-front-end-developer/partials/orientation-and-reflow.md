### Orientation and reflow

Every page must work regardless of the orientation of the device. This means switching between portrait and landscape should not cause any parts of the site to break.

The content should reflow if you scale the size of the window, and at no point should any text become unreadable at a minimum of 256px wide.

No items should scroll horizontally unless meaning would be lost otherwise. For example, an image or a complex data table.
