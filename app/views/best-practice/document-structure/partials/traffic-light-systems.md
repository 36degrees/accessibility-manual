1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have some form of red-green colourblindness. 

Red, amber and green is often used to show levels of severity. If you don't add additional context then to a lot of people everything will just look yellow.

Rather than just using colours, add labels such as low, medium and high. This means the information is still available to those people who can't see the colours correctly.
