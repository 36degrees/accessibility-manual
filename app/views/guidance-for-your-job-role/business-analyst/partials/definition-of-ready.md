### Definition of ready

When writing user stories, we outline criteria for when they are ready to build. This is usually when it's been through usability testing and the acceptance tests have been defined. But these discussions should also include accessibility.

As part of the stories definition of ready, make sure the team have discussed how the proposed design can be made accessible, and include important content in the story such as page titles and URLs as these can affect accessibility.

Work with an Interaction Designer and a Content Designer to understand which parts of the service might be tricky to build, for example things which do not exist already and will need to be built from scratch. These will require more testing. 

An example of accessibility considerations in a definition of done:
- Error messages, page titles and URLs agreed with Content Designer
- Content reviewed by team and accessibility considerations discussed
- Design reviewed by team and accessibility considerations discussed
