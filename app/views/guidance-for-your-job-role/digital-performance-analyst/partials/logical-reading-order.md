### Logical reading order

The reading order of the document should be top to bottom. It should be linear. There shouldn't be any need to have to navigate forwards or backwards to understand the section you're currently reading.

For statistical data, this usually means keeping all of the content together when discussing particular parts of the data set. Often, analysis will refer back to a particular graph or chart such as 'Figure 4', this means you need to keep skipping back and forwards through the document. For any user this can be tricky, but if you're using assistive technology it can very quickly become disorientating.

You should always summarise charts and graphs, and if you need to refer back to them then it is more accessible just to provide the summary again. For example:

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  ...if we refer back to the example in section 2 which shows that 45% of people over State Pension age have a disability...
</div>
