## Manual testing against WCAG

The point of manual testing is to make sure you test every page of your application against the A and AA criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. 

The only way you can do this without missing anything is to research each of the WCAG criteria and understand what the failures are. If you find any of the failures on your service, you can use the advisory techniques to fix them.

You can use the W3C [How to meet WCAG (Quick reference) with a filter to only show A and AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa) criteria.
