### Make sure stakeholders are informed

Accessibility is often an expense which is not considered until it's too late.

It takes time to develop and test for accessibility, and you may need an external audit before you can go into public beta. These time constraints and expenses will need to be communicated to stakeholders throughout the process so that it's part of their expectations. 

Make sure accessibility is budgeted for in both time and money, and does not simply get forgotten about.
