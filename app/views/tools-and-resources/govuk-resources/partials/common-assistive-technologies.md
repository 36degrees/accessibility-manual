## Common assistive technologies

If you're working to the Service Standard you will need to make sure your service works on the [GOV.UK list of common assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).

A [2016 GDS survey on assistive technology](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/01/results-of-the-2016-gov-uk-assistive-technology-survey/) and a [WebAim screen reader survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/) was used to create the list. It is updated several times a year, so don't always assume the list is the same as the last time you checked it.
