### Understand the risks

As a Product Manager you need to understand the risks of building a service which is not accessible. 

If your service is not accessible, then you won't be able to pass a [Beta assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works). But even worse, if you put a service live and it non-compliant, the service can be reported to the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

As the Enforcement Body the Equality and Human Rights commission has the power to issue enforcement notices, do investigations and even take court action against the department.
