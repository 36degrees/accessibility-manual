### Alternative text
Alternative text is a description of the image. You should make the alternative text helpful for the user and not just write anything in there to make the accessibility checker stop complaining.

The alternative text should give enough context so that even if you can't see the image you can have a good understanding of what it shows and your imagination can do a good enough job of working out what it might look like.

Example of bad alternative text:
`Cat`

Example of good alternative text:
`A cat wearing sunglasses`
