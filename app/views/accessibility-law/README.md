# Accessibility law

Accessibility is a part of several laws and standards we must follow. Each of the standards feed into the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) and the [Public Sector Equality Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-equality-duty).

If you are building anything which runs in a browser, you will need to meet the [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018](/accessibility-law/the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations-2018).

If you are procuring hardware or software you will need to meet the [EN 301 549 Accessibility Requirements for ICT products and services](/accessibility-law/en301549-accessibility-requirements-for-ict-products-and-services).

If you are working to the GOV.UK Service Standard you will also need to meet the [Government Accessibility Requirements](/accessibility-law/accessibility-regulations-vs-the-govuk-service-standard).
