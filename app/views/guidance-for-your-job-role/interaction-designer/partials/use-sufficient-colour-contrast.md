### Use sufficient colour contrast

Make sure the colour contrast is sufficient between text and surrounding elements. It should be 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for large text.

Large text is anything over 18pt, or bold text which is larger than 14pt.

Normal text is anything under 18pt and is not bold.

Don't use a font size less than 14pt. You can [read more about font sizes in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/).
